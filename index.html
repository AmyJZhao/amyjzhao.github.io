                            Implemented stable matching algorithm using <b>Python</b> that takes the same number of men and women and pairs them off based on preference in such a way that everybody ends up married to somebody and nobody is married to more than one person.

                            <br />
                            <u>Parameters</u>: <br />
                            - User inputs a number N of how many men and women are to be paired off (ex: user input of 1 means 1 pair to be matched) <br />
                            - Men are numbered 1 to N, and women are numbered 1 to N <br />
                            - Each man ranks all the women in order from highest preference to lowest preference (ex: Man 1's preference list is 2 4 3 1, so he most prefers to propose to Woman 2 while Woman 1 is last) <br />
                            - Each woman does the same and ranks all the men <br />

                            - Two two-dimensional arrays, ManPref and WomanPref, for women's preference lists and men's preference lists <br />
                            &#8195;- ManPref[m, i] denotes the ith woman on man m's preference list <br />
                            &#8195;- WomanPref[w, i] denotes the ith man on woman w's preference list <br />
                            - Linked list to hold set of free men who are not engaged <br />
                            - Array Next that indicates for each man m the position of the next woman he will propose to on his preference list <br />
                            &#8195;- Next[m] is initialized with 1 for all men m <br />
                            - Array Current to store current engagements <br />
                            &#8195;- Current[w] is initialized to None for all women to indicate they are not currently engaged <br />
                            &#8195;- Current[w] is woman w's current partner m' <br />
                            - N x N array Ranking where Ranking[w, m] contains the rank of man m in the sorted order of w's preferences (enables us to decide if man proposing to woman w is higher or lower on her preference list than her current fiance if she has one) <br />

                            Implemented a feature for an e-commerce fashion startup using <b>Liquid</b> that allows the product page to display other items worn by a model wearing a complete outfit. <br />Since styling is an important part of this new brand, it was crucial to display the different outfits that could be made from the individual tops, bottoms, dresses, and outerwear offered. Allowing customers to add these individual items without leaving the complete outfit product page made upselling more effective.

                    I wanted to gain some work experience that was tangentially related to web development even though I didn't know HTML/CSS and JavaScript at the time. Therefore, I sought an unpaid internship at an e-commerce startup that utilized WordPress. I became familiar with PHP and SQL through looking at the backend. I executed layout changes on the front end, implemented new features like a product filter that the website still uses, and troubleshooted and fixed issues like plugin incompatibility and 500 internal service errors.

I also participated in business plan competitions and pitches on behalf of Vanth by presenting the technical portions of the pitch deck. I also made layout refinements and created the order form on the Squarespace website that served as Vanth's MVP. Vanth was the $1,000 audience favorite and one of six finalists out of around twenty submissions for the 2017-2018 Lowell Milken Institute-Sandler Prize for New Entrepreneurs.
